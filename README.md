# Onemoreround - React

Yes friends, it's true: We made another React App...
This repository aims to resemble a small SPA with [React](https://reactjs.org/), [StyledComponents](https://styled-components.com/) and [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/). Each page consists of a basic React "mechanic" and is supposed to be used as a code example. We try to stick to up to date methods and conventions, but as always, these are subject to change.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/)

## Getting started

If you want to check this think out on your local machine clone or fork this repo and:

```
npm install
```

to get that juicy node_modules folder. And then:

```
npm start
```

Then to see what this thing looks like.

enjoy
